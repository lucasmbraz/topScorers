# Champions League Top Scorers

![Preview][0]

Android application that shows the Champions League top scorers for the current season. The data comes from [football-data's api][1] and the robot avatars are generated by [robohash][3].

This app follows the MVI architectural pattern with a few Robolectric tests.

## Credits

The MVI implementation is based on [Beno√Æt Quenaudon's][3] sample [todo app][4].
